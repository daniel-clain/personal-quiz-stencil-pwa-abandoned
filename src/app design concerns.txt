* im not sure about the way i instanciate everything in app-root
* my dependency injection feels like it could be an antipatter, eg, 
  - authService is injected into firestoreDbService, then authService and firestoreDbService are both injected into dataService
  - localDbService and firestoreDbService are injected into reconcileDataService, and then all 3 are injeced into dataService
